Student Feedback Analysis Dashboard – College Event/Course
2025 Event Feedback Report | Python • Pandas • Seaborn • VADER Sentiment
Python License: MIT Made for Medium
Overview
This repository contains the complete Jupyter Notebook and ready-to-publish Medium-style mini-report based on 1,001 real student feedback responses collected after a college event/course.
The analysis reveals a classic “happy words, unhappy numbers” scenario: students love the instructor and content (81 % positive sentiment) but feel overwhelmed by assignments and lack of doubt-solving support (overall satisfaction only 46.75 %).
